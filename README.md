FBI NICS Firearm Background Check Data
Introduction: The dataset used in this analysis comes from FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System.The dataset used in this analysis comes from FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. NICS is mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and launched by the FBI on November 30, 1998. NICS is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Before ringing up the sale, cashiers call in a check to the FBI or to other designated agencies to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The FBI provides data on the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type. These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS.Sales estimates are calculated from handgun and long gun background checks. Permit checks and other categories of background checks are excluded. The purpose of this analysis is to check the trend in background checks on hand gun and long run and as well check the top 5 states that have the highest background checks for fire arms.
